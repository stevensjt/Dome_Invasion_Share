#JTS Notes
-What's driving the apparent decrease in exotic percent cover in high-severity plots in 2019? 
It was a wet year and richness was up (I think cover was too?). Could it be some degree of competition from oak and locust?
-Would be interesting to look at oak and locust dynamics specifically.
-Differences between High-High and Mod-High plots?

- testty
- override with current version on the repo
- how many species are new in 2019?
- ask Kay about Heterotheca villosa and Cirsium neomexicanum - name changes?
- are oak locust dynamics competing with exotics?
- ordination analysis - x/y axis - each axis represents multiple variables - compressing multi dimensions to 2 dimensions: species composition - 98/97/ are they becoming similar over time? -- vegan package?
