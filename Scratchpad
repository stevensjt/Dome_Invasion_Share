#JTS Notes
-What's driving the apparent decrease in exotic percent cover in high-severity plots in 2019? 
It was a wet year and richness was up (I think cover was too?). Could it be some degree of competition from oak and locust?
-Would be interesting to look at oak and locust dynamics specifically.
-Differences between High-High and Mod-High plots?
