#JTS Notes
-What's driving the apparent decrease in exotic percent cover in high-severity plots in 2019? 
It was a wet year and richness was up (I think cover was too?). Could it be some degree of competition from oak and locust?
-Would be interesting to look at oak and locust dynamics specifically.
-Differences between High-High and Mod-High plots?
To-do for Feb 25 visit
1) A few CHECKME_JTS
2) Show Bianca and Kay the reconciliation document


#TE Notes
- QC data: classify new species in 2019 as exotic/native, search for unknown/sp. or spp. data and produce counts of each per year >>> species list given to Bianca for update on 01/16/20
- look at oak/locust expansion (as percent cover?) in high severity plots >> preliminary plots completed & pushed 02/16/20
- compare high-high and mod-high plots over time in ordination analysis (PCA, nMDS, etc.?). Are species   compositions in both severities converging over time? 

#BG Notes
- how many species are new in 2019?
- ask Kay about Heterotheca villosa and Cirsium neomexicanum - name changes?
- are oak locust dynamics competing with exotics?
- ordination analysis - x/y axis - each axis represents multiple variables - compressing multi dimensions to 2 dimensions: species composition - 98/97/ are they becoming similar over time? -- vegan package?
